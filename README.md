The Name of Your Work
===================================================================

General Description
What does your code do? What problem does it solve? 

A litle note: 
==== - these symbols underline the name of your work. They mark out the main heading.
###  - these symbols mark headings of 2nd level. 
''' print "Hello, world!" ''' - anything inside ''' ''' these brackets will be shown in typewriter setting (will look like a code)
These little things make your readme look nicer on github. Thank you!


### List of Files

In short, here you explain how to navigate through your files.
List here main code files and write what they do. 
If you have thousands of code files, then..  maybe you have directories? Write what is there in those directories.


### Instructions

Input: write here what's in the input files, what extension they have or anything that is relevant
Output: same for output
+ Add any instructions specific for your work.


### Dependencies (if any)

- if your code has any dependencies, 
- write them here
- for example, if your code was written on python 3.x and won't probably work on python 2.x, mention it here
- or if your code calls some non-standard module that needs to be installed separately, write its name here
- and so on 
if not, delete this section

### Future work

If 
- something is not finished, 
- or you know of some features that your code needs, but you haven't had time to add them, 
- or you know how to make your code better, but you're to lazy to do it yourself, 
- or there is something that could be done to your code in the future to make it extremely useful and helpful
write it all here!
